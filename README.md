This repository contains the following content:

1) The data directory contains datasets - information about each Walmart (accurate to March 2017) and Starbucks (accurate to February 2017) in the US. Furthermore, additional information such as walmart-starbucks ratio, population, and median income is computed in the ratio excel file. 2) The graph directory graphs the information that was found in the datasets. I graph the walmart-starbucks ratio to the household median income ratio in a scatterplot, the number of walmarts to household median income in a scatterplot, the number of starbucks to household median income in a scatterplot, and the walmart-starbucks ratio to state in a bar-graph.

3) Processing contains the python script that I used to read the walmart and starbucks datasets and compute their frequencies in each state from their respective datasets, and to compute the walmart-starbucks ratio.

4) The scraper directory contains the python script that I used to scrape the walmart and starbucks sites for their store and location information.
